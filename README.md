# Bus Real-Time Tracking System Dashboard âœ¨
 
## Overview

The Bus Real-Time Tracking System Dashboard is a web-based admin panel designed for staff to efficiently manage buses, routes, schedules, drivers, and students. It provides a streamlined interface with data visualization, including counters and a schedule calendar. The dashboard integrates with Google Maps API to enable route and bus stop configuration. It connects to a Spring Boot backend via REST API and utilizes Firebase for data storage.

## Features
- **Route Management**: Create, view, update, and delete routes with dynamic Google Maps integration.
- **Schedule Management**: Manage schedules while ensuring no bus or driver is assigned to overlapping time slots.
- **Driver, Bus, Announcement & Student Management**: Maintain and manage driver and student records with advanced filtering and search functionality.
- **Data Visualization**: Provide a dashboard with key statistics for better insights.
- **Google Maps API Integration**: Dynamically configure routes and bus stops for optimal navigation.
- **Enhanced Data Accessibility**: Implement filtering, searching, and sorting across all lists for better usability.
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Leverage Firebase for seamless live data updates.
- **Admin-Only Staff Management**: Only administrators can create, update, or remove staff accounts.
